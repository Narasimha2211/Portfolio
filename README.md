# My Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my work as a Machine Learning Engineer and Full Stack Developer.

## About

I'm Narasimha Reddy Kasarla, and I work with machine learning and web development. I've taken some great courses including the Stanford Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng and Angela Yu's Full Stack Web Development course. 

I really enjoy working on new ideas, joining hackathons, and building things that can actually help people.

## What's Inside

This portfolio has a clean design that works well on all devices. I added some nice animations and interactive elements to make it more engaging. The site includes information about me, my projects, what I like to do in my free time, and how to get in touch.

## Tech Stack

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used Font Awesome for icons and Google Fonts for typography. Nothing too fancy - just solid, clean code.

## Projects Featured

- Music Recommendation System using machine learning
- Crop Prediction System for agriculture
- Blog Editor with full CRUD functionality  
- Web-based Agro Alert system
- Fact-checking website using NLP

## Site Structure

The portfolio is organized into sections: a hero area with some floating tech icons, about me, my projects, hobbies (I love math!), and contact information.

## Running Locally

To view the portfolio:

1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Narasimha2211/Portfolio.git
